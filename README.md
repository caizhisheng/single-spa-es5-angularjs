# single-spa-es5-angularjs
A single-spa example with an es5 angularjs app. Note that this example is extremely minimalistic and intended just to show that single-spa with es5 is possible.
It is not intended to be full blown starter-kit for those with es5 angularjs apps.

See [this issue](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-angular1/issues/35) for the inspiration behind this repository.

## Usage
```bash
npm install # or yarn install
npm start
```

Note that this requires [single-spa-angular1@2.7.0](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-angular1/releases/tag/v2.7.0) or above.
